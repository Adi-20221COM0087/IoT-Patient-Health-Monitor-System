# IoT-Patient-Health-Monitor-System

This project implements a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) patient health monitoring system using the ESP8266 microcontroller, MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor, DS18B20 and DHT22 temperature sensors, and the Blynk cloud platform. It enables remote monitoring of vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), body temperature, and room humidity through a mobile application. Developed with Arduino IDE, the system transmits sensor data wirelessly, provides automated alerts for abnormal readings, and supports data logging for healthcare providers and caregivers. Designed for ease of deployment and low cost, the solution is ideal for home-based patient care, chronic disease management, and early detection of health anomalies. Key features include multi-sensor integration, real-time cloud dashboards, secure authentication, continuous monitoring, and scalability for multiple patients in diverse environments.
